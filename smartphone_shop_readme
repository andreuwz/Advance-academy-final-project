This is a short example of a smartphone shop Spring Boot project, made with IntelliJ, written in Java programming language.

The idea behind the project is that a user with some initials can have a cart, which can be filled with different smartphones. One user can have one cart. But many smartphones can belong to one cart, therefore to one user.
The project is made using the concept MVC, which consists of repositories, controllers, models and services. On top of that, there is added a Dto (data transfer object) package which contains sensitive user data (which is not displayed publicly) and a sample test class. 
All the data is stored using MySQL DB.

This is my first standalone project, any type of criticism is accepted. Spring security was not included in the project, due to time constrains.
